# cyberblast Maumau Server

Node native "Maumau" card game server

[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/cyberblast%2FMaumauServer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/cyberblast%2FMaumauServer)

This is a project I mainly like to work at when I like to do something but actually don't know what. There is no deadline or any need to complete this.

Goal: Develop a fully playable multiplayer [Maumau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mau-Mau_(card_game)) card game.

Way: I'd like to develop a mostly native node server. That means - I don't like to use existing modules/packages/extensions as far as possible.
